    <h1>Practice BOM Scripting - New Page</h1>

<!--8.	Create a new page called newpage.html. You will now have 2 web pages including indexPart1a.html and newpage.html. Add a button to index.html. When the button is clicked, newpage.html should appear as a popup window at 300 pixels wide by 300 pixels high. As soon as newpage.html loads however, resize the window to 500 pixels wide by 300 pixels high. You will need to handle the load event on newpage.html and use a BOM method on newpage.html to accomplish this task.
